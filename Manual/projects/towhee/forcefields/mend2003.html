     <ul>
      This section covers the Mendelev <i>et al.</i> 2003 iron parameters as they are implemented into the 
      towhee_ff_Mend2003 file in the ForceFields directory.  All of the Towhee atom types for this force field 
      are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.  This force field was intended for solid and liquid
      simulation of iron and uses the 'Embedded Atom Method' potential and is not easily combined with other 
      potentials due to the explicit mixing rules used with that potential.
      I would like to acknowledge Mikhail Mendelev for kindly providing me with an electronic copy of these parameters.
      Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values are the sole responsibility of Marcus Martin,
      and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.
     </ul>

     <b>Typos and clarifications for Mend2003</b> 
     <ul>
      <li>a<sub>7</sub><sup>phi</sup> in Table A 1 is listed incorrectly and should be negative instead 
       of positive, as noted on 
       <a href="http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/graeme/moldy/moldy.html">Graeme Ackland's metals page.</a>

     <b>Mendelev <i>et al.</i> 2003 in Towhee</b> 
     <ul>
      The official force field name for these parameters is 'Mend2003'.  Here I list the 
      atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description (although 
      the meaning of the atom names should be obvious).  There were two parameterizations presented 
      in that paper and they are both implemented here.
      Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important and must be followed exactly as listed here.

       <dt>'<b>Fe-p2</b>' : iron potential 2.  Uses a 5.2 Angstrom cutoff.</dt>
       <dt>'<b>Fe-p4</b>' : iron potential 4.  Uses a 6.0 Angstrom cutoff.</dt>
      </ul>
     </ul>
     <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
     <ul>
      There are no coulombic interactions for this potential.
