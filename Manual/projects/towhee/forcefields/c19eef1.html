    <td valign="top"> <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      This section covers the C19eef1 force field (a modified version of Charmm19 that includes the EEF1 implicit
      solvent model) as it is implemented into the towhee_ff_c19eef1 file in the ForceFields directory.  All of the Towhee atom
      types for the C19eef1 force field are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.  Note that Charmm19 is a
      '12-6 plus solvation' classical_potential with 'explicit' classical_mixrule so it cannot currently be combined with any other forcefields.
      The implicit water solvation is controled with the <b>solvation_style</b> parameter in the towhee_input file.
      Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published C19eef1 force field values are the sole responsibility of Marcus Martin,
      and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.
     </ul>

      There are parameter (param19_eef1.inp) and topology (toph19_eef1.inp) files 
      that are extremely helpful, but are only available in the Charmm28 distribution.

     <b>C19eef1 in Towhee</b> 
     <ul>
      The official force field name for C19eef1 in Towhee is 'C19eef1'.  Here I list all of 
      the C19eef1 atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.  C19eef1 
      denotes extended-atom for cases where the hydrogens and the heavy element they are bonded to are all 
      lumped into a single interaction site.
      Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
      and must be followed exactly as listed here.  I include the atom notes from the Neria paper.

     </ul>
     <b>Coulombic Interactions</b> 
     <ul>
      C19eef1 utilizes point charges on atomic centers to represent the charge distribution on a molecule.  As far as I know,
      there is no automated system for assigning the charges in C19eef1.  However, C19eef1 uses a neutral group approach for 
      most moities found in organic molecules.  The charge distibution is similiar to that used in Charmm19, except the ionic side 
      chain amino acids are neutralized, and the specifics on how to do this can be found in Lazaridis and Karplus 1999.  
      Otherwise, it is fairly easy to scan through the example molecular charge distributions found in the files available at the 
      <a href="../software.html#charmm">Charmm</a> web site and determine what charges to apply to the molecule you wish to simulate.
     </ul>
     <b>Improper torsions</b> 
     <ul>
      Improper torsions are not automatically generated by the Towhee code as the rules for determining where they are
      applied are not always straight-forward.  C19eef1 exclusively uses the out-of-plane version of the improper torsions, and
      they are typically centered on an sp<sup>2</sup> atom in order to enforce planarity with its three neighbors.  These torsions
      are listed in the C19eef1 literature as i-j-k-l where the angle is the dihedral between i-j-k and j-k-l.  The bonding
      pattern is not completely clear to me, but it appears that either i or l is the central atom which is bonded to all three
      of the other atoms, and none of the other three atoms are bonded to each other.  In the towhee_input file the improper
      torsions is listed starting from the central atom and the three other atoms are listed in the same order as C19eef1.
      So, if the central atom is i, then the atoms are listed j, k, l.  If the central atom is l then the atoms are listed k, j, i.
     </ul>
     <b>Proteins</b> 
     <ul>
      All of the 20 basic amino acids (including the 3 forms of hystidine)
      are functional for the C19eef1 force field. I have implemented the atom types and charges according to the published 
      Ch19eef1 values.  Below is a complete list of the codes for the 20 amino acids, plus some other functional groups that 
      work with the protein builder.  C19eef1 does not apply a torsion across all set of atoms connected by 3 bonds 
      in the amino acids.  The torsions are explicitly listed for these systems in the polyc19eef1.F routine.  I tried 
      to faithfully reproduce all of their energetics, but had to make some accomodations for tryptophan.  They have 
      two torsions in tryptophan that span atoms that are not bonded together and those are not implemented into Towhee.
