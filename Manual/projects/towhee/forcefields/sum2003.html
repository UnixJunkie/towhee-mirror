    <td> <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      This section covers the Sum <i>et al.</i> 2003 United Atom (NERD) force field as it is implemented into
      the towhee_ff_Sum2003 file in the ForceFields directory.
      This forcefield is an extension to the <a href="nerdv2.html">NERDv2</a> force field that allows the simulation of acetates and glycerols.
      It is implemented in a separate file as the energy units in this paper are different from the previous ones and this results in minor
      (and most likely insignificant) differences in the Carbon-Carbon bond energies.
      I would like to acknowledge Mary Biddy for providing useful guidence about implementing this force field.
      Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values are the sole responsibility of Marcus Martin,
      and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.
      This forcefield was changed in version 8.1.0 so that the forcefield name is always just 'NERD' for all of the various implementations.

     <b>Sum2003 in Towhee</b> 
     <ul>
      The official force field name for Sum <i>et al.</i> United Atom in Towhee is 'NERD'.
      This list contains all of the atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.
      I created these atom names in order to work with the molecule assembler and made them consistent with the other NERD forcefield names.
      Sum2003 is a united-atom force field that lumps hydrogens onto their neighboring carbons.
      Note that hydrogens that are bonded to atoms other than carbon are not lumped onto their neighboring atoms.
      The general pattern of the names is a list of the atoms that make up the group, followed by the hybridization of the central atom,
      and ending in a character string that distinguishes similar atoms.
      Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important and must be followed exactly as listed here.

      This is the list of charge assignments for methylacetate.
      It appears that these are also the charges used for an acetate headgroup on other molecules (e.g. glycerols).

      <dt>'<b>Osp2</b>' : -0.500</dt>
      <dt>'<b>CH3sp3cac</b>' : 0.050</dt>
     </ul>
     <b>Improper torsions</b> 
     <ul>
      This force field does not utilize improper torsions.
