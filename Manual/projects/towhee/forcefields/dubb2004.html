    <td valign="top"> <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      This section covers the Dubbeldam <i>et al.</i> (Dubb2004) force field as it is implemented into the towhee_ff_Dubb2004 file in the ForceFields directory.
      This force field is for adsorption simulations of alkanes in various Zeolites.
      Note that this is a Lennard-Jones force field that uses explicit mixing rules so it is not easily combined with other force fields.
      Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values are the sole responsibility of Marcus Martin,
      and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.
     </ul>
     <b>References for Dubb2004</b> 
     <ul>
      What I term Dubb2004 is described in several papers.

      In addition, some of their torsional interactions are overly complicated.  The torsions 
      involving the <b>CH</b> group are specified in terms of where the hydrogen would be if it was explicitly 
      included in the simulation.  Thijs Vlugt suggested replacing the torsions involving the <b>CH</b> group 
      with those from the TraPPE-UA forcefield and I have followed that suggestion for this implementation.

     <b>Dubb2004 in Towhee</b> 
     <ul>
      The official force field name for Dubbeldam <i>et al.</i> United Atom in Towhee is 'Dubb2004'.
      This list contains all of the atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.  I created these
      atom names in order to work with the molecule assembler.  Dubb2004 is a united-atom force field which lumps
      hydrogens onto their neighboring carbons.  It is also designed for work with Silaceous and aluminum substituted 
      zeolites.  The general pattern of the names is a list of the atoms that 
      make up the group, followed by the hybridization of the central atom, and ending in a character string that 
      distinguishes similar atoms.
      Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important and must be followed exactly as listed here.

      There are specific charge assignents for the atoms in the zeolite framework and these assignments are enforced 
      by the angle potential for the zeolite.  There are no charges on the alkane united-atoms.  The 'bond increment'
      method of <b>charge_assignment</b> is implemented for this forcefield.
      Here is a	list of the charges that are assigned by the 'bond increment' method.

       <dt>'<b>Al</b>' : 1.75</dt>
       <dt>'<b>O</b>' bonded to two silicons: -1.025</dt>
       <dt>'<b>O</b>' bonded to one silicon and one aluminum: -1.20</dt>
       <dt>'<b>Na</b>' : 1.0</dt>
       <dt>'<b>C</b>' : all alkane carbons have a 0.0 charge.</dt>
