    <td valign="top"> <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      This section covers the Potter <i>et al.</i> 1997 (Potter1997) force field as it is implemented into the towhee_ff_Potter1997 file in the ForceFields directory.
      This force field was designed to reproduce the vapour-liquid equilibria for three different fluoromethane molecules.
      Note that this is a Lennard-Jones force field that uses the 'LB plus manual' mixing rules, and therefore you need to explicitly set some cross terms
      in towhee_input in order to use this force field as the authors intended.
      Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values are the sole responsibility of Marcus Martin,
      and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.

     <b>Typos and comments for Potter <i>et al.</i> 1997</b>
     <ul>
      <li>Please note that you need to explicitly set the cross terms for H and F in towhee_input in order to properly
       reproduce their work.  The cross terms for the H-F interactions should have a sigma of 2.3 Angstrom and an epsilon 
       of 22.36 Kelvin.  See the <a href="../examples/example_manual.html#Potter_CF2H2">Potter_CF2H2</a> example for 
       more information about how to set these cross terms.

     <b>Potter <i>et al.</i> 1997 in Towhee</b> 
     <ul>
      The official force field name for Potter <i>et al.</i> 1997 in Towhee is 'Potter1997'.
      This list contains atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.
      I created these names in order to distinguish between the different hydrogen and fluorine parmeters that are used depending upon the 
      extent of methane fluorination.
      Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important and must be followed exactly as listed here.
      <ul>

     <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
     <ul>
      This force field uses point charges and has been set up to assign the point charges using the bond increment method.
      The charges for bmim are assigned according to Table 1 of 
      <a href="../references.html#potter_et_al_1997">Potter <i>et al.</i> 1997</a>.
