     <ul>
      This section covers the Siepmann-Martin-Mundy-Klein (SMMK) force field for branched alkanes as it is implemented 
      into the towhee_ff_SMMKmain file in the ForceFields directory.
      All of the Towhee atom types for this force field are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.
      SMMKmain uses a 'Lennard-Jones' classical_potential and the 'Geometric' classical_mixrule.
      Unlike its predecessor (<a href="sks.html">SKS</a>) the SMMKmain force field uses tail corrections, and was originally used with a 13.8 Angstrom cutoff.
      The SMMKmain forcefield is an extension of the <a href="sks.html">SKS</a> force field for linear alkanes and
      was immediately supplanted by similar parameters included in the same paper 
      (see <a href="smmknaip.html">SMMK Note Added in Proof</a> and eventually superceded by the <a href="trappeua.html">TraPPE-UA</a> force field.
      Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published force field values are the sole responsibility of Marcus Martin,
      and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.

     <b>References for SMMK Main</b> 
     <ul>
      Most of the nonbonded parameters and detailed results for the SMMK Main force field are found in the main text of the 
      following paper.
      <ul>
       <li><a href="../references.html#siepmann_et_al_1997">Siepmann <i>et al.</i> 1997</a></li>
      </ul>
      This is a fully flexible model where the intramolecular terms for all of the atoms, and some special One-Five 
      nonbonded terms for <b>CH3methyl</b> groups are taken from.

     <b>SMMK Main in Towhee</b> 
     <ul>
      The official force field name for SMMK Main in Towhee is 'SMMKmain'.
      This list contains all of the atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.
      Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important and must be followed exactly as listed here. 
      <ul>
       <dt>'<b>CH3long</b>' methyl group (C plus 3 bonded H as a united-atom) on an <i>n</i>-alkane of C<sub>4</sub> or longer,
	or on an alkyl side-chain of length propyl or longer.</dt>
       <dt>'<b>CH3ethyl</b>' methyl group (C plus 3 bonded H as a united-atom) on an ethyl side-chain.</dt>
       <dt>'<b>CH3methyl</b>' methyl group (C plus 3 bonded H as a united-atom) on an methyl side-chain.</dt>
       <dt>'<b>CH2</b>' methylene group (C plus 2 bonded H as a united-atom).</dt>
       <dt>'<b>CH</b>' methine group (C plus 1 bonded H as a united-atom).</dt>
       <dt>'<b>C</b>' quaternary carbon.</dt>
      </ul>
     </ul>
     <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
     <ul>
      There are no coulombic interactions for this force field.
