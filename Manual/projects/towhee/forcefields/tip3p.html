    <td valign="top"> <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      This section covers the TIP3P force field for water as it is implemented into the towhee_ff_TIP3P file in the ForceFields directory.
      All of the Towhee atom types for this force field are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.
      This is among the most popular water potentials of all time and several other force fields use similar parameterizations.
      TIP3P is a rigid water model that has a Lennard-Jones site on the Oxygen and bare charge sites on the Hydrogens.
      The Jorgensen group has also parameterized two other water models that utilize additional interaction sites.
      Please see the <a href="tip4p.html">TIP4P</a>and <a href="tip5p.html">TIP5P</a> web pages for more information 
      about those water models.
      This water model is suitable for use with any Lennard-Jones forcefield, but is especially well suited for the OPLS family of potentials.
      Please see the <a href="oplsua.html">OPLS-ua</a>,	<a href="oplsaa.html">OPLS-aa</a>, and <a href="opls2001.html">OPLS-2001</a> web pages for more information.
      Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published force field values are the sole responsibility of Marcus Martin,
      and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.

     <b>References for TIP3P</b> 
     <ul>
      TIP3P was originally published in the following paper
      <ul>
       <li><a href="../references.html#jorgensen_et_al_1983">Jorgensen <i>et al.</i> 1983</a></li>
      </ul>
     </ul>
     <b>TIP3P in Towhee</b> 
     <ul>
      The official force field name for TIP3P in Towhee is 'TIP3P'.
      This list contains the atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description taken from the literature.
      Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important and must be followed exactly as listed here. 
      <ul>
       <dt>'<b>H</b>' : hydrogen in water</dt>
       <dt>'<b>O</b>' : oxygen in water</dt>
      </ul>
     </ul>
     <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
     <ul>
      TIP3P uses atom-centered point charges to represent the electrostatic interactions.
      The 'bond increment' method for assigning charges is implemented for this force field.
      Here I list the bond increments for the atom names listed above.  The value of the bond increment is added 
      to the first atom listed and subtracted from the second atom listed.
      <ul>
       <dt><b>H</b> - <b>O</b>: 0.417</dt>
      </ul>
