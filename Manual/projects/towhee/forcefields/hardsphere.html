    <td valign="top"> <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      This section covers Hard Sphere parameters as they are implemented into the towhee_ff_HardSphere file in the ForceFields directory.
      It is a bit strong to call this a force field, as all there is to the hard spheres is a series of sigma values, but this page explains
      how to use the builder with the hard sphere potentials, and how to add in any other hard sphere diameters that 
      you might want to use in a simulation.
     </ul>
     <b>Hard Spheres in Towhee</b> 
     <ul>
      The official force field name for Hard Spheres in Towhee is 'HardSphere'.  Here I list all of 
      the Hard Sphere atom names currently in use for the towhee_input file, along with a brief description (although 
      the meaning of the atom names should be obvious).  If you want to add any new hard sphere diameters into Towhee
      just take a look in the <a href="../code/code_manual.html#ffhardsphere.F"><code>ffhardsphere.F</code></a> subroutine.
      Search for one of the atom types listed below and you will find the complete listing of hard sphere parameters.
      It is relatively easy to add new atom diameters from the examples.
      Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important and must be followed exactly as listed here.
      <ul>
       <dt>'<b>hs0.0</b>' : hard sphere with 0.0 diameter.
	This behaves like an ideal atom, but it is still excluded from being inside of other atoms.  Thus it is a hard point potential.
       </dt>
       <dt>'<b>hs0.5</b>' : hard sphere with 0.5 diameter.</dt>
       <dt>'<b>hs1.0</b>' : hard sphere with 1.0 diameter.</dt>
      </ul>
     </ul>
     <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
     <ul>
      It is possible to combine the hard sphere potential with point charges.
      Simply assign the point charges to the atoms as you feel appropriate.
     </ul>
     <b>Improper torsions</b> 
     <ul>
      There are no improper torsions set up specifically for hard spheres.
     </ul>
