    <td valign="top"> <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      This section covers the DACNIS United Atom force field as it is implemented into the towhee_ff_DACNIS-UA file in the ForceFields directory.
      All of the Towhee atom types for the DACNIS United Atom force field are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.
      DACNIS-UA is a little force field I created for performing some simulations of methane and ethane adsorption in silicalite using a cut-and-shift potential.
      This was useful as the main application of the force field was computing the transport of methane through	silicalite using
      the dual control volume grand canonical molecular dynamics code Ladera.
      Note that DACNIS United Atom is a Lennard-Jones (12-6) force field and can only be combined with other Lennard-Jones (12-6) force fields.
      I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.

     <b>DACNIS-UA in Towhee</b> 
     <ul>
      The official force field name for DACNIS United Atom in Towhee is 'DACNIS-UA'.
      This list contains all of the DACNIS atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description.
      I created these atom names in order to work with the molecule assembler.
      DACNIS-UA is a united atom force field so it lumps atoms together.  There are only three different groups.
      Note that the Ozeo group is designed for a fixed conformation of silicalite so it has no bonded interactions.
      Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important and must be followed exactly as listed here.
      <ul>
       <dt>'<b>CH4sp3</b>' : methane</dt>
       <dt>'<b>CH3sp3</b>' : sp<sup>3</sup> non-aromatic carbon bonded to three hydrogens and one heavy atom</dt>
       <dt>'<b>Ozeo</b>' : oxygen groups in silicalite.</dt>
      </ul>
     </ul>
     <b>Coulombic interactions</b> 
     <ul>
      There are no coulombic interactions in the DACNIS-UA force field.
     </ul>
     <b>Improper torsions</b> 
     <ul>
      DACNIS-UA does not utilize improper torsions.
