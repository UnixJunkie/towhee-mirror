    <td valign="top"> <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      This section covers the Ackland <i>et al.</i> 2004 iron and phosphorus parameters as they are implemented into the 
      towhee_ff_Ackl2004 file in the ForceFields directory.  All of the Towhee atom types for this force field 
      are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.  This force field was intended for solid and liquid
      simulation of iron with small amounts of phosphorus impurities, uses the 'Embedded Atom Method' potential,
      and is not easily combined with other potentials due to the explicit mixing rules used with that potential.
      I would like to acknowledge <a href="https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~gja/">Graeme Ackland</a> for providing an
      electronic copy of these parameters on his web page.
      Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published values are the sole responsibility of Marcus Martin,
      and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.
     </ul>

     <ul>
      The official force field name for these parameters is 'Ackl2004'.  Here I list the 
      atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description (although 
      the meaning of the atom names should be obvious).  There were two parameterizations presented 
      in that paper and they are both implemented here.
      Please note that the capitalization and spacing pattern is important 
      and must be followed exactly as listed here.

      There are no coulombic interactions for this potential.
