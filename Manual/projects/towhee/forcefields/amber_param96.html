    <td valign="top"> <b>Overview</b> 
     <ul>
      This section covers the Amber param96 force field as it is implemented into the Towhee code.
      All of the Towhee atom types for the Amber param96 force field are listed, along with a short description of their meanings.
      Note that Amber param96 is a Lennard-Jones (12-6) force field and can only be combined with other Lennard-Jones (12-6) force fields.
      I would like to acknowledge Wendy D. Cornell and the late Peter A. Kollman for providing very useful guidance about implementing Amber param96.
      Any discrepencies (especially typos) from the published Amber param96 force field values are the sole responsibility of Marcus Martin,
      and I welcome feedback on how this implementation compares with other programs.

      The official force field name for Amber param96 in Towhee is 'Amber96' and the file name is towhee_ff_Amber96 in the ForceFields directory.
      This list contains all of the Amber96 atom names for use in the towhee_input file, along with a brief description taken from the

     <b>Coulombic Interactions</b> 
     <ul>
      Amber 96 uses point charges located at atomic centers to represent the elecrostatic interactions between atoms.  
      There is no simple, general table of charges for atoms in this force field.
      Instead, they recommend using the RESP method to fit the charges for each molecule of interest.  
      See the protein section below for comments on the Amber param96 charges used with the protein builder.
     </ul>
     <b>Improper torsions</b> 
     <ul>
      Improper torsions are not automatically generated by the Towhee code as the rules for determining where they are applied 
      are not always straight-forward.  Amber param96 exclusively uses the Stereocenter version of the improper torsions, and they
      are typically centered on an sp<sup>2</sup> atom in order to enforce planarity with its three neighbors.  Only one 
      improper torsion allowed to be centered on any atom.  These torsions are listed in the Amber literature as i-j-k-l where the 
      angle is the dihedral between i-k-l and j-k-l, and the bonding pattern is i, j, and l are all bonded to atom k, and are also not
      bonded to each other.  In the towhee_input file this stereo improper torsion is listed only for atom k, and the atom order there 
      is l, i, j.
      Automatic improper type determination is implemented for this force field.
     </ul>
     <b>Proteins</b> 
     <ul>
      All of the 20 basic amino acids (including the 3 forms of hystidine and the thiol and disulfide forms of cysteine)
      are functional for the Amber96 force field. I have implemented the atom types and charges according to the published 
      Amber param96 values except in the following cases.
      <ul>
       <li>N-terminal leucine: the electronic files for Amber param96 list CD1 with a charge of -0.41060 and atom CD2 with a charge
	of -0.41040.  These atoms are symmetric and indistinguishable in reality so I felt it made no sense to give them different
	charges just because they have different names.  Therefore I put a charge of -0.41050 on both atoms.
       </li>
       <li>N-terminal phenylalanine: the electronic files for Amber param96 list CE1 with a charge of -0.16020 and atom CE2 with a charge
	of -0.16030.  These atoms are symmetric and indistinguishable in reality so I put a charge of -0.16025 on both atoms.
       </li>
      </ul>
