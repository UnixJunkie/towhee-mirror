     <b>Towhee Project Executive Summary</b> 
     <ul>
      Towhee is a Monte Carlo molecular simulation code originally designed for the prediction of fluid phase equilibria using atom-based force fields
      and the Gibbs ensemble with particular attention paid to algorithms addressing molecule conformation sampling.  The code has subsequently been
      extended to several ensembles, many different force fields, and solid (or at least porous) phases.
      <p></p>
      It is the hope of the developers that Towhee serves as a useful tool for the molecular simulation community and allows science to move forward more
      quickly by eliminating the need for individual research groups to rewrite routines that already exist and instead allows them to focus on algorithm
      advancement, force field development, and application to interesting systems.
     </ul>
     <p></p>
     <b>A Brief History of MCCCS Towhee</b> 
     <ul>
      The Monte Carlo for Complex Chemical Systems (MCCCS) program was first developed in 1994 in
      <a href="http://siepmann.chem.umn.edu/">J. Ilja Siepmann's research group</a> at the University of Minnesota starting with software dating
      back to the dawn of the configurational-bias Monte Carlo method.  From 1994 to 1999 the code took shape as J. Ilja Siepmann, Marcus G. Martin,
      Bin Chen, Collin D. Wick, Jeffrey J. Potoff, and John M. Stubbs all implemented (and developed) algorithms and force fields for predicting phase
      coexistence using Monte Carlo.  This research on MCCCS was supported by the National Science Foundation (Siepmann), and the Department of Energy (DoE) 
      <a href="http://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">Computational Science Graduate Fellowship</a> (Martin and Wick).
      In 1999 the MCCCS program was placed under a <a href="code/gpl.html">GNU general public license</a>, but was not widely distributed. 
      <p></p>
      In 2000 the DoE Office of Industrial Technologies, later renamed the <a href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/">Industrial Technologies Program</a>,
      funded Marcus Martin and some industrial collaborators to make MCCCS accessible to the broad molecular simulation community by creating a web manual,
      improving the ease of use, and distributing the code via the web.  This new version was called MCCCS Towhee, and is maintained by 
      <a href="mailto:marcus_martin@users.sourceforge.net">marcus_martin@users.sourceforge.net</a>.
      <p></p>
      In 2003 Towhee began migrating to the SourceForge site and it finished moving there completely in September of 2005.  The user base has continued
      to swell, and new developers are leaving their mark upon the code.  Instructions for downloading, unpacking, and compiling the current Towhee 
      release are found on the <a href="code/download.html">Towhee download web page</a>.
