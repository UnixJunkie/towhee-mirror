     This section describes the input parameters associated with an <b>input_style</b> setting of 'basic connectivity map' where the details of the force 
     field parameters are determined via the <a href="../code/code_manual.html#buildmolec.F"><code>buildmolec.F</code></a> and
     <a href="../code/code_manual.html#assemble.F"><code>assemble.F</code></a> subroutines.
     This documentation is maintained for the current version of the code and was 
     last modified for Version 8.0.0.  The '<a href="inpstyle_6.html">advanced connectivity map</a>' option is a more powerful and flexible version of this builder. 
     The 'basic connectivity map' option requires the specification of a forcefield and the appropriate parameter names for that force field.
     See the individual manual pages for each force field (summarized on <a href="../towhee_capabilities.html">Towhee Capabilities</a>) for detailed information about
     the atom names.  This feature enables the automatic determination of all of the vibration types, bending angles, bending types, regular torsion angles,
     regular torsion types, angle-angle terms, angle-angle types, and improper torsion types that are implied by the bonding structure of the molecule.
     However, automatic determination of atoms that require an improper torsion is not possible with this option and users who require that feature should use the
     '<a href="inpstyle_6.html">advanced connectivity map</a>' option. 
     <dt><a name="nunit"><b>nunit (integer)</b></a>
      <ul>
       The number of atoms (or united-atoms) in this molecule. Must be less than or equal to <a href="../code/code_manual.html#numax">NUMAX</a>.
      </ul>
     </dt>
     <dt><a name="nmaxcbmc"><b>nmaxcbmc (integer)</b></a> 
      <ul>
       The maximum number of atoms to regrow during a <a href="../algorithm/cbmc.html">configurational-bias</a> regrowth move.
       It is safe to set this to the value of <a href="#nunit"><b>nunit</b></a>, but no configurational-bias regrowth moves beyond
       a certain size are ever accepted then it is more efficient to set this to the largest value where moves are accepted to avoid
       wasting effort on move that are very likely to fail.
      </ul>
     </dt>
     <dt><a name="lpdbnames"><b>lpdbnames (logical)</b></a>
      <ul>
       <li><code><b>.TRUE.</b></code> input information about the pdb (protein data bank) atom name, amino acid number, amino acid name. This 
        information is needed in order to use the cartoon feature of certain pdb viewers (such as <a href="../software.html#rasmol">Rasmol</a>).
       </li>
       <li><code><b>.FALSE.</b></code> do not input additional pdb information.
	This does not disable the output of a pdb file, it just means things like the protein cartoon feature might
        not work properly in <a href="../software.html#rasmol">Rasmol</a>.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </dt>
     <dt><a name="forcefield"><b>forcefield (character*10)</b></a>
      <ul>
       The forcefield that you want to use to build this molecule.  A summary of available force fields is provided on the 
       <a href="../towhee_capabilities.html">Towhee Capabilities</a> page.
      </ul>
     </dt>
     <dt><a name="charge_assignment"><b>charge_assignment (character*30)</b></a>
      <ul>
       <li>'bond increment': the bond increment method is used to assign the charges on each atom and the parameter <a href="#charge"><b>charge</b></a> is not required.
        Note that this method is only functional for certain forcefields.  Please check the individual force field documentation to see if this is
        available for your force field of interest.
       </li>
       <li>'manual': the charges on each atom are manually specified in the towhee_input file as the parameter <a href="#charge"><b>charge</b></a>
	in the following section.</li>
       <li>'none': a zero charge is assigned to each atom and the parameter <a href="#charge"><b>charge</b></a> is not required.</li>
      </ul>
     </dt>
     <hr></hr>
     <font color="red">This section is repeated for each atom in the molecule.</font> 
     <dt><a name="unit"><b>unit (integer)</a>, <a name="atomname">atomname (character)</a>, <a name="charge">charge (double precision)</b></a>
      <ul>
       Three parameters listed on a single line.
       First, <b>unit</b> is the number of the atom in order starting from atom number 1. This is used to help the user keep track of the 
       molecule as they are building it in the input file. If the unit number listed in towhee_input does not match the running total 
       of unit numbers in Towhee then the code will stop with an error message.
       Second, <b>atomname</b> is the character string that contains the atom type for the forcefield.  Information about valid atomtypes is found 
       in the documentation for each force field (summarized on the <a href="../towhee_capabilities.html">Towhee Capabilities</a> page).
       Finally, <b>charge</b> is the charge on this atom.
       This is only required if the <a href="#charge_assignment"><b>charge_assignment</b></a> is set to 'manual'.
      </ul>
     </dt>
     <dt><a name="pdbname"><b>pdbname (character), aminonum (integer), aminoshort (character)</b></a>
      <em>only if <a href="#lpdbnames"><b>lpdbnames</b></a> is <code><b>.TRUE.</b></code></em>
      <ul>
       Three parameters on a single line.
       First, a four letter/number string that is output in the pdb file. The precise spacing is important if you want to get most pdb 
       viewers to recognize the atoms as the pdb file is extremely specific.
       Second, the number of each amino acid starting from the N-terminus.
       Third, the three letter code for each amino acid, or other group (such as caps on the C or N termini).
      </ul>
     </dt>
     <dt><b>vibration</b> 
      <ul>
       <li>The first line under the vibration heading is the number of atoms that are bonded to the current atom (internally <b>invib</b>).
	Must range from 0 to <a href="../code/code_manual.html#nnbond">NNBOND</a>.
       </li>
       <li>The second line contains the atom numbers for all <b>invib</b> atoms that are bonded to the current atom. </li>
      </ul>
     </dt>
     <dt><b>improper torsion</b> 
      <ul>
       <li>The first line under the improper heading is the number of improper torsions (any form) which have the central atom located at the current
        atom (internally <b>inimprop</b>.
	You must list all improper torsions which have the current atom at the central position, but you do not list improper torsions which contain 
        the current atom at one of the ends. Must be a number between 0 and <a href="../code/code_manual.html#maximprop">MAXIMPROP</a>.
       </li>
       <li>The next <b>inimprop</b> lines underneath the improper torsion heading are a list of the other atoms in the improper torsion
	(internally <b>ijimprop2</b>, <b>ijimprop3</b>, <b>ijimprop4</b>)
	and the improper force field number (internally <b>itimprop</b>)
	for the <b>inimprop</b> improper torsions that contain the current atom at the central atom.  There are currently three different 
        forms of improper torsions, and these forms are specified in the force field.  In all cases, the three atoms must all be bound to the current atom.  
        If you want Towhee to automatically determine the improper torsion type then enter an <b>itimprop</b> value of 0.
       </li>
      </ul>
